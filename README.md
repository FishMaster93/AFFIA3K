We create a new audio dataset for FFIA (Fish feeding intensity assessment), namely AFFIA3K, which containing 3000 labelled audio clips of different fish feeding intensity (None, Weak, Medium, Strong). 
To encourage further research, we have also released the AFFIA3K dataset and the pre-trained model at:
